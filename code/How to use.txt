How to implement:

- Open Google Drive and create a new Google Sheets file.

- Create a new Google Form connected to the Google Sheets file. Add a question for the submission number and make it required.

- In the Google Sheets file, go to Tools > Script editor to open the Google Apps Script editor.

- Copy and paste the code (from getSequencialID.js file) into the script editor: 

- Save the script and give it a name.

- In the script editor, select "Resources" > "Current project's triggers".

- Click the "Add Trigger" button and configure the trigger to run the onFormSubmit function when a user submits the form.

- Save the trigger and close the trigger dialog.

- Deploy the script as a web app by selecting "Publish" > "Deploy as web app". Set the access level to "Anyone, even anonymous", and click "Deploy".

- Copy the URL of the deployed web app.

- Go back to the Google Form editor and select "Responses" > "View responses".

- Submit a new response to the form to test the script. You should see a message box displaying the submission number.

- Share the form with users and instruct them to submit their responses through the web app URL you copied in step 10. They will see the submission number as soon 
as they submit the form.

That's it! You have now implemented the Google Apps Script that retrieves the submission number of a Google Form response.
